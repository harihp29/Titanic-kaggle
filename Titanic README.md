# Titanic-kaggle
Titanic 2nd attempt score notebook 

The titanic kaggle project gave me the first understanding of a competition. It also gave me the prespective of how to approach a real time project and a lifetime learning that I can carry forward with . Even though I struggled as a beginner to bring things together eventually I was happy to understand and post my first kaggle competition.I would be working on improvising my approaches and on bringing about more interesting ideas.   

The first attempt score was 0.38 , predicted based on the gender column. The second attempt was made analysing various notebooks and information on kaggle. 
The flow of the notebook goes as below,

   1. Importing basic libraries
   2. Reading the data sets
   3. Analysing the given data
   4. Missing values in train and test datasets
   5. Visualisation Functions
   6. Cleaning data and visualising the plots
   7. Analysing the correlation matrix
   8. Assigning the train and test data
   9. Working on the model
